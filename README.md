# dfrws2010-challenge
The DFRWS2010 Challenge Results Challenge offered a chance to perform forensic analysis of memory dumps from a Sony Ericsson mobile device. This challenge was designed to be accessible to a wide audience, combined accessible forensic analysis tasks with some harder problems. We were pleased that the submissions this year came from not just researchers and developers, but also practitioners in the community.  Some aspects of the challenge could not be completed using existing tools and new techniques had to be developed. However, many of the questions could be answered without developing new approaches.
